Most of the MP3 projects and tutorials online are about making a simple, bare minimum MP3 player that has pause/resume and song changing
functionality and no resemblance to established MP3 players.They are solely for the purpose of learning things, not for use. Most of them have horrible color themes (no offense).
With this project, I decided to go a step ahead (correction: many steps ahead ) and add a ton of features, some of which are not even present in established MP3 players such as installing songs directly from YouTube (No one cares about copyrighting music).You could essentially use this in your day to day life if you have tons of downloaded songs.
Some of the features are:
1.	A slider. There isn’t a single bloody python MP3 project out there that has a functional slider along with song data [ duration, time elapsed]
2.	Feature to directly install songs from youtube
Just input the link and the program downloads the song from youtube and handles all the conversions.
3.	Playlist creation/editing

The program stores playlist data in a json file...Created playlists can also be edited
5.	Looping songs: The fact that most of the projects online don’t have this simple but much needed function is rather surprising.
6.	Auto Play: Another easy but required feature that is essential for day to day use.
7.	Shuffle: The fact that its as simple as random.shuffle(list) and still not implemented is amusing
8.	Dark Theme: Who does not like dark theme (unless you’re a weirdo who likes light theme). Every windows tkinter project looks horrible due to the blocky scrolls and thick window titles. CustomTkinter helped me overcome it.
9.	Animated Song Names[still under work]: It’s a simple sliding animation, but it still makes the MP3 player look so much more better. Just an extra touch because why not
   
If my code[including this README.md] seems unprofessional….there is nothing I can do about it. I took a break from programming for 2 years and I am kinda happy I could still make this project(idk abt you all but I liked it).Plus it was really fun.
